# H-FGAT
## Abstract
Driver drowsiness is a leading cause of traffic accidents, highlighting the critical need for effective real-time monitoring systems. Although electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a direct indicator of a driver's cognitive state, developing a generalized detection model remains challenging due to the non-stationarity of signals and significant inter-subject variability. To address these limitations, this study proposes the Hierarchical Functional Graph Attention Network (H-FGAT). H-FGAT dynamically constructs brain networks based on learned functional connectivity and effectively extracts drowsiness-related patterns by integrating node-level micro features into higher-level Meso-states through hierarchical architecture. To validate the model, we utilized data from 11 subjects collected in a virtual driving environment and assessed its generalization performance using a subject-independent evaluation scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed H-FGAT achieves superior classification performance compared to existing graph neural network models. Consequently, this study suggests that modeling functional connectivity and integrating hierarchical information are essential factors for building robust drowsiness detection systems.
